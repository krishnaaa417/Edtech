    <h2>The Name of the Author : KRISHNAA</h2>
    <p>
      Krishna was born and raised in Tadipatri, a town known for its rich
      culture and hardworking people. Growing up, he displayed an eagerness to
      learn and excel in various fields.

    <p>
      During his academic years, Krishna developed a strong foundation in
      programming, problem-solving, and software architecture. His logical
      thinking and analytical mindset set him apart from his peers. He was
      always fascinated by how technology could shape the world, and this
      interest fueled his ambition to become a part of the tech industry’s
      elite—FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) companies.
